# üåæCrop Expert ‚Äî An AI-based Crop Recommendation for farmers

Crop Expert is an AI-powered decision-support system for farmers that recommends suitable crops, fertilizer plans, irrigation advice, pest guidance, and financial estimates based on soil, weather and market context. Built with Streamlit, it combines explainable ML (RandomForest), live weather, geolocation and simple agronomic heuristics into a lightweight, usable dashboard.

# üîç Abstract

‚Ä¢	Agriculture is one of the most crucial sectors of the Indian economy, yet many farmers continue to face the challenge of crop misselection ‚Äî choosing crops that are not well-suited to their soil, climate, or market conditions. ‚ÄúCrop Expert‚Äù is an AI-powered smart agriculture assistant that recommends the most suitable crops for cultivation based on soil characteristics, weather conditions, and market demand.

‚Ä¢	The system integrates machine learning (Random Forest Classifier) with real-time environmental data (using Open Meteo API) and geo-intelligence (via Geopy). It empowers farmers and agricultural planners with actionable insights ‚Äî from fertilizer guidance and irrigation scheduling to profit estimation and pest control suggestions.

‚Ä¢	With its user-friendly Streamlit-based interface, Crop Expert not only predicts suitable crops but also generates a comprehensive digital report, complete with financial analytics, visual dashboards, and voice summaries, making agriculture smarter, data-driven, and sustainable.

# üå± Introduction

In modern agriculture, the decision of which crop to cultivate can determine the success or failure of a farming season. Traditionally, these decisions are based on experience, intuition, or local advice, often ignoring scientific data such as soil fertility, moisture levels, rainfall patterns, and market trends.
The purpose of this project is to bridge this gap by building an AI-based system that recommends the best crops for a given region, backed by machine learning models trained on environmental data.

**Problem Context**

‚Ä¢	Unscientific crop selection: Many farmers still rely on traditional practices, leading to low yields.

‚Ä¢	Climate variability: Changing rainfall and temperature patterns affect productivity.

‚Ä¢	Soil degradation: Lack of knowledge about soil health causes nutrient imbalance.

‚Ä¢	Market unawareness: Farmers often grow crops that are not in demand, leading to losses.

**Objective**

Crop Expert aims to help farmers make data-driven cultivation decisions by providing:

‚Ä¢	Accurate crop recommendations based on soil, weather, and market data.

‚Ä¢	Fertilizer and irrigation advice to enhance yield.

‚Ä¢	Pest and disease prevention tips.

‚Ä¢	Profit and cost analysis for better economic planning.

‚Ä¢	Multilingual & voice-enabled accessibility for ease of use in rural regions.
